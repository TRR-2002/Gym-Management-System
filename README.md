The Gym Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and manage various operations within a fitness center. Built using PHP for server-side logic, MySQL (MariaDB) for database management, HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and minimal JavaScript for client-side enhancements, this project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for both gym members and staff. The system facilitates member registration, login, plan management, progress tracking, and feedback submission. For staff, it provides tools to manage assigned members, create and assign fitness plans, and view their own profiles and schedules. The core objective is to create an efficient digital platform that enhances the gym experience for members and simplifies administrative and operational tasks for staff.

In addition to member and staff features, the system includes a comprehensive Admin portal. This section gives administrators full control over the entire gym management system. Admins have their own secure login and a central dashboard to access all management functions. They can manage all member accounts, including adding new members, editing their details, or removing them. Similarly, admins can manage all staff accounts, including creating new staff profiles, updating their information, and managing staff schedules or roles. Admins also have superuser privileges over fitness plans, allowing them to create, view, edit, or delete any plan in the system, regardless of which staff member originally created it. Furthermore, they can assign any plan to any member. The admin portal also includes a section for reviewing all member feedback and a dedicated area for viewing system-wide data analytics and reports, providing insights into member activity, popular plans, and overall gym operations.
